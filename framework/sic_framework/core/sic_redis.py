"""
A wrapper around redis to provide a simpler interface for sending SICMessages, using two different API's. The blocking
API is used for devices, from which we expect a reply when the action is completed. The non-blocking API is used for
services, which do not have to wait for a response as communication is one way only.

Non-blocking:
    ## DEVICE A
        r.register_message_handler("my_channel", do_something_fn)

    ## DEVICE B
        r.send_message("my_channel", SICMessage("abc"))


Blocking:
    ## DEVICE A
        def do_reply(channel, request):
            return SICMessage()

        r.register_request_handler("my_channel", do_reply)

    ## DEVICE B
        reply = r.request("my_channel", NamedRequest("req_handling"), timeout=5)

Note: You can send a non-blocking request by sending with send_message("channel", SICRequest()), but this
is somewhat discouraged as it may lead to harder to understand behaviour. The same goes for sending messages
to request handlers with
